# CrowdBox

## What is it?
Have the urge to start a dance party...right now? Well, CrowdBox is a crowd sourced flashmob boombox that harnesses the speaker power of multiple mobile devices in the same vicinity to create an exponentially louder sound.

One device alone play music is negligible, but multiple that by 10 or 20 devices and you've created an orchestra of sound!

## Our Philosophy
We want to encourage movement and dancing at a moment's notice. CrowdBox promotes people to smile, have fun, and enjoy the moment.
